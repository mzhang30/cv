        <p>I did not follow a traditional career path as most people do. After graduating from college, I started a media startup instead of working for large, well-established companies. My company mainly provides customers with multimedia content
          such as graphic design, interactive animation, commercials, and motion graphics.</p>
        <p>After 8 years of entrepreneurship, I think my life should be turned into a new leaf. So I came to Los Angeles in 2021 to pursue new goals at <a href="https://annenberg.usc.edu/"><strong><em>USC's Annenberg</em></strong></a>. Here, I gained
          a different international perspective and new insights.
